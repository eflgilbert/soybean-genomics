## RScript to map introgressions
### introgression_finder.r


<li> Scoring the loci of each NIL</li>
<li> Imputing missing scores</li>
<li> Calculating the likelihood of an introgressed locus</li>
<li>  Predicting introgression intervals</li>
<li> Creating an Output</li>



## Result samples

<b>ab_logP.jpeg</b> - A plot of the -log of the probability that a polymorphic locus is from the donor parent 
<br><b>ab_results.txt</b> - A file which is meant to be opened in excel. It can be color coded and used to scroll through the genomes of all trait (in this case ab) NILS, their donor parents and recurrent parents. This file can be used to visually confirm introgressions.
